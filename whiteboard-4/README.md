###problem domain

we need a function that will look at 2 arrays and find the items that match and push that to a new array that we can then return.

##test 1
  I need a test to see if there is anything that is passed into the argument

##test 2
  I need a test to check if we passed in 2 arrays for us to compare, if no return null.

##test 3
  I need a test to check to see if both items that are passed in are arrays.

##test 4
  I need a test to see what we get back are the correct answers that we are expecting to get back.

##test 5
  I need a test to see if the new array i made is empty, i need it to return a string saying 'no matching pairs'.
