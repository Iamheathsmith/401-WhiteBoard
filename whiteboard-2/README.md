###problem domain

we need to write a function that takes in a numeric array and returns an object literal with two properties: - The highest and second highest value in the array

we also needs to write at least four tests for this function - Your tests should cover basic functionality

#test 1
  needs to checks to see if nothing was passed in. if nothing was passed in, it should return null.

#test 2
  needs to checks to if an empty object was passed in. if an empty object was passed in, return null.

#test 3
  needs to check if what was passed in was an array and if it was not, return null.

#test 4
  needs to check if the array that was passed in is longer then 2 numbers. if it was not longer then 2, then return null.

#test 5
  needs to check if the array that was passed in is a number at every index of it. if not, when you remove the !number, it will still have a array length to have the 2 highest numbers

#test 6
  needs to check and see if the answer that comes out is the expected answer that we want.

#test 7
  checks to see if there are duplicates and if so, only return the 2 highest in the group.
