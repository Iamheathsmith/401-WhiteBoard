###problem domain

I need a function that will take in a Single listed list and find the middle node of it and then return that node for me.

##test 1
  I need a test to see if there is anything that is passed into the argument

##test 2
  I need a test to check if we passed is a object and not just an number.

##test 3
  I need a test to see what we get back are the correct answers that we are expecting to get back

##test 4
  I need a test to see that if we passed in a even number it will then take the counter and - 1 to the total and pick that to send back.
